								<h3><span>My Credit Plan:</span> The Industry’s Leader in Loan Analysis and Score Improvement</h3>
								<hr class="small-line" />
								<p>There are 92 credit scores (not a typo – 92) available to consumers. All credit scores are different and vary over 100 points with the vast majority not used by lenders. Only 3 are used for all mortgages and most other credit transactions. Unfortunately, access to these 3 Classic FICO® scores is restricted because of “Consumer-direct” prohibitions by the credit industry. Only at My Credit Plan, can you access these scores (a soft inquiry) and find the following remarkable tools since Family Financial is a 501(c)(3) non-profit credit counselor.</p>
								<p>You want answers – now you have them at your fingertips, with My Credit Plan! This is an outline of all the services and information found at My Credit Plan:</p>

							<h3>1. Mortgage 850: Maximizing Your Home Purchasing Power</h3>
							<hr class="small-line" />
							<p>There are over 90 different rate and fee adjustments based on credit score and down payment with the most popular mortgages as outlined in this chart from Fannie Mae. When you compare mortgages with the same lenders, you are only comparing the mortgage with one of those 90 possibilities.</p>

							<p>Lenders don’t give you a “Oh, you’re close so we will give it to you the better loan”. You either have the required credit score or you do not. Even if you are 1 FICO® Score below, you will not qualify for the better loan. <strong>Every point matters!</strong></p>

							<div class="program-placeholder">
								<img src="./img/program/placeholder-1.jpg" alt="Img" />
							</div>

							<p>Source: Fannie Mae</p>
							<p>When you apply for a mortgage (or any loan), the lender pulls the Classic FICO Score – say 715. You go to another lender, and they pull the same FICO Score of 715, unless something dramatic has happened in your credit report impacting your score. You go to the third lender, and that lender pulls the same 715 credit score.</p>

							<p>If you put 5% down and have a $400,000 mortgage, the loan level price adjustment costs (see chart for LLPAs) associated with that mortgage is $4,500 ($400,000 * .01125 = $4,500) – under 5% down and 715 credit score. Every lender has to pay this $4,500 fee. When you shop your mortgage to multiple lenders, all lenders must pay the same fee – or $4,500 - for that mortgage to the guarantor.</p>

							<br />

							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-sm-7">
									<h4>Loan Box</h4>
									<p>Lenders put your loan into the same loan box, with the same fees impacting your closing costs and interest rate. You are limited in trying to find a lower interest rate and payment because of the loan fess attached from the lender’s backside of the transaction. Loan officers don’t care if you pay these LLPA fees because it is your loan and you are paying these fees. Many don’t even realize these fees are being accessed to you because their respective companies don’t disclose it to their loan officers.</p>
									<p>You have to get out of that loan box and reduce those LLPA fees in order to secure the best mortgage. Shopping your mortgage will not reduce these LLPA fees if you have the same credit score.</p>
									<p>You can do better. The best option that lenders never discuss is if you can make adjustments to your loan from a higher credit score or down payment and what it does to your purchasing power, interest rate and monthly payment. Mortgage 850 does that with its proprietary technology to help you find the best mortgage loan by finding ways in which you can lower these LLPA fees.</p>
									<p>You could literally saves tens of thousands of dollars as highlighted in this chart!</p>

									<h5>What does Mortgage 850 do that lenders do not? Many things.</h5>
									<p>1. Maximum Mortgage Qualifications</p>
									<p>2. Purchasing Power based on a Specific Payment</p>
									<p>3. Changes in Purchasing Power on Different Interest Rates</p>
									<p>4. Maximizing Your Purchasing Power Based on a Specific Payment</p>
									<p>5. Lowest Monthly Payment on a Home Comparing Loan Programs</p>
									<p>6. Payment Adjustments Based on Different Interest Rates</p>
									<p>7. Finding a Better Path to Securing the Lowest Payment Possible</p>

									<p>You can discover what purchasing power you have base don’t the same payment as those LLPA fees are reduced which often results in a lower interest rate.</p>

									<p>Mortgage 850 provides your potential mortgage qualifications tailored to your situation. It identifies your purchasing power based on a specific payment, your changes in purchasing power, a path to greater purchasing power, finding the lowest payment utilizing multiple loan programs, payment adjustments based on different interest rates, and securing the lowest payment on a mortgage.</p>

									<p>How does Mortgage 850 find the better mortgage? It finds areas you can reduce these LLPA fees which in turn lowers your interest rate and costs. As illustrated in this graphic “Mortgage 850: Changes in Purchasing Power”, this identifies how the purchasing power changes with the same payment, while increasing the FICO Score.</p>

									<p>The reviews are in – and consumers are in “awe” of the incredible insight Mortgage 850 provides. It is a game changer for home buyers and those that want to refinance. It does all the work of a loan officer and more – but you get access in seconds, not days.</p>

									<p>Remember, Family Financial is not a lender. Even though Family Financial partners with lenders to provide this insight, you must still work with a lender to finalize your mortgage.</p>

							<p>Most consumers think that comparing loan options with different lenders will allow them to find the best auto loan. That is not true in most instances. Why?</p>
							<p>Auto lenders utilize upwards of 12 different FICO scores. My Credit Plan utilizes the 3 main credit scores most auto lenders use.</p>

					<h3>3. Lender’s Credit Report and<br />3 Classic FICO® Scores</h3>
					<br />
					<p>There are 92 different credit scores with 67 of them created by FICO®. All of these scores produce a different 3-digit result. All mortgage lenders utilize the 3 Classic FICO® Scores that have a range of 300 to 850, and most lenders also use these 3 scores for other types of lending including credit cards and auto loans. Of the 92 credit scores, these are the only 3 you should track.</p>

					<p>Important: Assessing your lender’s credit report and 3 Classic FICO Scores does not show up as a hard inquiry and drop your credit scores.</p>

					<br />
					<img src="./img/program/img-1.jpg" alt="img" />
					<br /><br />

					<p>The “Consumer-Direct” industry policy prohibits companies form giving you the same credit scores lenders use. For this reason, the credit scores you access from various sources are ones of the nearly 80-non lender credit scores. These credit scores are different from lender’s credit scores. For this reason, lenders do not use that credit score found in the internet, or the ones even offered from your credit card company, bank or credit union.</p>

					<p>Only through a non-profit can you access the same credit report and scores lenders utilize.</p>

					<p>Until now, counseling organizations have generally been prohibited by their contracts with the credit reporting agencies from giving the consumer the credit report or score that they have purchased on that consumer’s behalf. For example, a nonprofit organization that purchases a credit report with a FICO credit score has typically signed a three-way agreement with one of the three large credit reporting agencies (TransUnion, Equifax, or Experian) and FICO, agreeing not to provide the report or score to any entity, including the consumer.</p>

					<p>This no-sharing policy is common in contracts signed by business users of credit reports and scores. Until now, counseling organizations have generally been prohibited by their contracts with the credit reporting agencies from giving the consumer the credit report or score that they have purchased on that consumer’s behalf. For example, a nonprofit organization that purchases a credit report with a FICO credit score has typically signed a three-way agreement with one of the three large credit reporting agencies (TransUnion, Equifax, or Experian) and FICO, agreeing not to provide the report or score to any entity, including the consumer.</p>

This is especially effective for those that are looking to purchase a home.</p>

						<p>The 2-Score update allows you to update your Classic FICO® Scores at 2 scores every month at a reduced cost. My Credit Plan will update your TransUnion® and Experian® FICO® Scores the first month, TransUnion and Equifax Classic FICO Scores the second month, and the Experian and Equifax Classic FICO Scores the third month. The rotation then starts over the fourth month and will go through the same cycle.</p>

						<p>The 1-Score update has 1 FICO Score update every month. This is a consumer favorite at a reduced cost. My Credit Plan will update your 3 Classic FICO Scores one score every month. Your Equifax Classic FICO is updated the first month for example, your Experian Classic FICO score is updated the second month, and the TransUnion Classic FICO Score is updated the third month. My Credit Plan will then rotate back and start over the fourth month with the Equifax Classic FICO Score. This allows you to track your 3 Classic FICO Scores at a reduced cost.</p>
